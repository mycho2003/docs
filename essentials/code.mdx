## Basic

### Inline Code

To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

### Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of your snippet to get syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code after the programming language.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

      <Tab title="Fail Validate (Mobile Flow)"> 
      <Step title="Send Auth Token to the Front End">
        Your back end will send the authToken to the front end SDK to do the possession handling. During the mobile flow, use 1111 to simulate a failed OTP when presented with the following OTP page. 
            <Frame>
              <img src="/images/docs/OTP.png" />
            </Frame>       
      Once the front end finishes the possession check, the back end calls the /validate endpoint with the correlation ID to authenticate the trustworthiness of the phone number.  
        
      The test user then fails /validate. 
        ```json Response
        {
          "next": {
            "done": "done"
          },
          "success": false,
          "challengeMissing": false
        }
        ```
      The Prove flow is terminated and the front end proceeds to another authentication method.
